    <h1>What is a MERN Stack?</h1>
    <p>A collection of strong and capable technologies called MERN Stack is used to create sophisticated online
        web-based applications that include a database, frontend side, and back end. Full-stack web apps can be made
        more rapidly and readily with JavaScript. A full-stack JavaScript framework called MERN Stack is used to create
        dynamic webpages and applications. The MERN stack course is popular nowadays because the Mern stack is comprised
        of four powerful technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.</p>

    <h2><i><u>Four Components of the MERN Stack</u></i></h2>
    <h3>1. MongoDB: A Document-Oriented Database for Any Platform</h3>
    <p>An accessible, cross-platform data database application is known as MongoDB. It has JSON-based schemas and is a
        NoSQL database (optional). Because MongoDB distributes at its core, it has high availability and horizontal
        scaling. MongoDB's features include geographical distribution, end-to-end security, highly available, and
        scalability.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>2. Backend framework (Express): Express is a backend development platform for Node.js</h3>
    <p>Compared to when Node.js is functioning, it offers numerous advantages that make constructing web apps simple and
        quick. It's simple to set up and customize. Express. It helps developers define HTTP- and URL-based application
        routes. In order to enable extra tasks, Express comes with a number of middleware components. Finally, Express
        makes it simpler for your application to deliver static resources and files. During your MERN stack developer
        Course, you will learn everything.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>3. React is the name of a third-party front-end programming library</h3>
    <p>React is a transparent, cost-free JavaScript front-end framework that was released by Facebook. It is used to
        design UIs for interactive online applications (user interfaces). It manages the view layer and can create web
        and mobile apps. Developers can join isolated segments in React that each maintains their own state to produce
        complicated user interfaces. React automatically renders on the server while using Node.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>4. Runtime Environment for Node.js
    </h3>
    <p>The Node.js runtime environment is fully accessible and pass, and it supports JavaScript for the back end. You
        can run JS code outside of an internet browser thanks to a rendering engine Node.js, which is a V8 engine.
        Developers may manage server files, gather form data, change database data, and produce dynamic web pages with
        Node.js.</p>
