                    <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi
                        neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal
                        emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1639, when he
                        decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is
                        credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort
                        represents the peak in the Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persian palace
                        architecture with Indian traditions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fort">Read More

                <li><b>Humayun’s Tomb</b><br><br>

                    <p>Humayun's tomb (Persian: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of Mughal emperor, Mirza Nasir al-Din
                        Muhammad commonly known as Humayun situated in Delhi, India.[1] The tomb was commissioned by
                        Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum under her patronage[2][3][4][5][6] in
                        1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad,[7] Persian architects
                        chosen by her.[8][9] It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent,[10] and is located
                        in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old
                        Fort), that Humayun found in 1538. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such
                        a scale.[11][12] The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993,[10] and since then
                        has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete.[13] Besides the main tomb enclosure
                        of Humayun, several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance
                        in the West, including one that even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the
                        tomb complex of Isa Khan Niazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty,
                        who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.
